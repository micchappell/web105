                        Remember when your parents told you not to do something and you immediately went
                        and did it? That's the Forbidden City for you. Don't go. Or, use reverse psychology
                        and go. Doesn't matter. Just quit running around in the kitchen and getting under my feet.
                    </p>

                        Now it would have made a lot more sense if the creatures in The Great Wall were actually in
                        the Forbidden City. Or maybe they were in the Forbidden City
                        and they came to the Great Wall? I really can't remember. I think I'd had a couple of beers in
                        order
                        to sit through that one.

                        Anyway, TripAdvisor gives it 4.5 stars. I think it's worth checking out.
