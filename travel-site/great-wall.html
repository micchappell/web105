                        Perhaps the most well-known of all China's landmarks, the Great Wall is the setting for an
                        unfortunate movie of the same name. They must have backed up the proverbial dumptruck full of
                        money in Matt
                        Damon's front yard. An uninspired script and bad cgi creatures did a terrible disservice to this
                        truly spectacular landmark.

                        Hey, but seriously folks, this is one sight to behold.

                        Begun as a series of walls meant to keep out nomadic raiders, the Great Wall was formed over
                        many
                        centuries. The Great Wall is approximately 5500 miles long, with almost 4000 miles being actual
                        wall
                        and the remainder of that span a series of trenches and natural barriers such as rivers and
                        rivers.

                        Pro tip: bring some comfortable shoes if you're planning on taking the full tour.
