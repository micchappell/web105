                        Once the imperial garden of the Qing dyansty, The Summer Palace is located
                        in Northwest Beijing. While the name implies a singular structure, the Summer
                        Palace is actually a collection of buildings, gardens, and lakes.

                    <p>
                        Pavillions, towers, and bridges dot the landscape. The original structures were
                        built beginning in 1153. Construction continued through the centuries. Periodically, from
                        1271 all the way to 1895, additional buildings, waterworks projects, and refurbishing was
                        conducted.

                        While the Summer Palace is a popular tourist destination, it is also popular with locals
                        given its rich history.
