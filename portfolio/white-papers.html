                <p>
                    Once your video has created awareness and introduced your product, white papers and e-books are
                    great for the next step:
                    discovery and evaluation. If your video and web site copy have done their job, your visitors will
                    want to learn more.
                    White papers and e-books are a great content offer that you can use to collect contact information
                    from interested
                    prospects.

                    And, they allow the buyer to download a piece of content to take with them when they
                    leave your site, which
                    means they still have a connection to you after they leave your site. Use these long-form content
                    formats to show your customers and prospects that you understand their
                    problem and can
                    provide an effective solution. This is a critical step, because when you show an understanding of
                    your prospect's
                    problem, you begin to build trust.
