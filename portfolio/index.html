                    Generally speaking, there's nothing better than an above-the-fold video that introduces visitors to
                    your company. Why
                    make them hunt for information on your site? People are busy, and you are competing for their time.
                    If you can grab
                    their interest in 90 seconds with a video introduction to your company, do it!

                    With video, you
                    control the tone, the
                    pace, and the personality that creates your brand. Music, motion, voice, and design all combine to
                    tell your story more
                    completely than any other form of content. And how-to videos are vital: they show your customers and
                    prospects how to
                    unlock all of the value your company offers through its products and services.
