                    Case studies are one of the most effective ways to build trust with customers. In fact, it will
                    probably be one of the
                    first things your sales team wants. And if your product works across industry verticals, be sure to
                    create case studies
                    for each industry. You want prospects to be able to relate to the successes of your existing
                    customers.

                <p>
                    The case studies themselves aren't difficult to create, and a quick ten minute interview with an
                    existing customer is
                    plenty of time to get the information you need. Record the interviews; this way you can get exact
                    quotes easily. A good
                    case study identifies the customer's challenge, your solution, and the result. Be sure to provide
                    some background
                    information on the customer, too. And make sure you have at least one knock-out quote.
