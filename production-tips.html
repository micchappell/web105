                            We want our featured guests to look great on camera, but not everyone knows how
                            to use lighting and camera position to look their best.

                    <h2>The Solution</h2>

                    <p>
                        Lighting is one of the biggest problems when you don't have the proper equipment. Interior,
                        overhead lights
                        can create hotspots on the forehead, bridge of the nose, and cheeks. And even worse, overhead
                        lighting can create dark shadows that
                        hide the subjects eyes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Camera angle is another important consideration, and with the tripod we made earlier, it's going
                        to be easy to make sure our featured
                        guests get nice footage of themselves for our video project.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And finally, we're going to talk about awareness of your surroundings, and I'm going to show you
                        a simple trick
                        I used to make the location where I was shooting look a lot better.
