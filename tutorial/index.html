                            McHenry County College's new Center for Agrarian Learning was supposed to be promoted
                            to local highschools through in-person meetings and discussion forums. With Illinois
                            campuses at all grade levels close, and group gatherings currently prohibited, how
                            could the Center get its message to the public?

                    <h2>The Solution</h2>

                    <p>
                        Video presentations were chosen to replace the in-person events. I worked with Sheri Doyel
                        to shoot video of her segments. Because we were only a two person group, it was acceptable
                        for us to meet on campus and shoot at selected locations. These locations were chosen to
                        highlight the content of each of the three video segments. We filmed in the greenhouse for the
                        segment on growing local vegetables with hydroponics, at the outdoor growing houses, called
                        tunnels,
                        for the year-round growing segment, and out in one of MCC's growing fields for the segment on
                        sustainable, grass-fed cattle.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We had one other problem, though. Each segment also featured a local expert on their farm
                        demonstrating
                        the techniques that Sheri discussed in her introduction. Normally, I would go to those locations
                        and
                        shoot those segments, as well. However, due the social distancing rules in effect I was not able
                        to
                        access those locations as I normally would. Therefore, we knew we had to rely on the featured
                        guests
                        to shoot their own segments, and we knew they would be using cellphones.

                        Our solution? Shoot a tutorial video with some tips for getting good smartphone video. And yes,
                        I shot
                        it on a smartphone. The original video is about 5 minutes, but here I broke it up into its three
                        main segments.
