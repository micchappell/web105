        <h1>Independent Short Film Makers - SF</h1>
        <p>
            During my final two years in San Francisco, I joined ISFM to share my experience with aspiring film makers
            in the Bay
            Area. It was a loosely knit group, and all were welcome, regardless of their experience level. I primarily
            provided
            technical guidance and post production assistance. Below are some of the shorts in which I took a more
            active role.
        </p>
        <h2>Pushing My Buttons</h2>
        <p>
            This is the short in which I was most engaged. I helped the director with shot selection and storyboarding.
            I also
            served as a camera operator on some shots, edited the short, and created the music.

        <h2>Waxed</h2>
        <p>
            The is episode one of what was envisioned as a web series about a soldier returning home to find that his
            former
            girlfriend is engaged to his best friend. This was by far the most ambitious project undertaken during my
            time at ISFM.
            While I wasn't active in the pre-production or production phase, I was brought in to edit the footage.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were quite a few challenges due to the shooting style. The entire project was shot in a hand held
            style with the
            camera moving among the actors. This didn't provide much coverage, and often times I had to cut around the
            movement to
            get reaction shots that properly conveyed the feeling of the scene.

        <h2>Fem Wars - monologue</h2>
        <p>
            This is one of the first things I shot for ISFM. We did a camera training session at a studio, and as part
            of the
            training session we had an actor perform a monologue. This also provided an opportunity for everyone to get
            experience
            directing an actor. This is the take that I shot during the exercise.
