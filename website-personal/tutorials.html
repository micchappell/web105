        <h1>Tutorials</h1>
        <p>
            While I haven't had time to do any tutorials recently, here's a selection of some techniques that are still
            relevant and
            applicable in 2019.
        </p>
        <h2>Create an Animated Logo in After Effects</h2>
        <p>
            In this tutorial, we'll do some image manipulation in Photoshop to create a logo. Then we'll import the logo
            to After Effects, where we'll add some styling to create a 3D look. We'll create a 3D environment
            for our logo by cutting up a 2D photo and positioning it in 3D space, and then we'll add a few finishing
            touches to blend all of the elements together.

        <p>
            Learn how to take a collection of different iceberg photos and blend them in Photoshop to create one
            complete iceberg. Then we'll composite
            the iceberg in an After Effects compostion with a sky and a simulated water surface.
