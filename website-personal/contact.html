            You can find me in the Office of Marketing and Public Relations at McHenry County College.

            You can also see a full version of this website on Wordpress at <a href="https://www.mikec.pro"
                target="_blank">https://www.mikec.pro</a>. That version uses a template and some 3rd party
            plug-ins, so it's
            more advanced than what's here, and also contains more content.

            And in case you're wondering, no I didn't copy paste the code from the Wordpress site â€“ although the code
            there looks familiar enough now that I might have been
            able to do that with some slight modifications. I did copy paste the body copy from my original text
            documents for that site, however.
