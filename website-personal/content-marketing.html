        <h1>Content Marketing Increases Sales</h1>
        <p>
            While I'm a video producer at heart, I had a great opportunity to become the Content Marketing Manager at
            Versal. It was
            the proverbial "offer you can't refuse," so I didn't. Here's what I learned...
        </p>
        <h2>How Content Marketing Increases Sales</h2>
        <p>
            A well designed and executed content marketing strategy improves your sales in the following ways:
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>
                Connects you with your customers and prospects.
            </li>
            <li>
                Builds trust between you and your customers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Improves the quantity of your leads.
            </li>
            <li>
                Improves the quality of your leads.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Connecting With Your Customers (and Prospects)</h2>
        <p>
            Content marketing is the best way to connect with customers and prospects. You aren't just selling goods or
            services,
            you're providing value that improves the lives of your customers. Or at least you should be, if you want to
            be
            successful. You want to build relationships with your customers. And, you want to make sure they understand
            all of the
            value your product holds, so they get the maximum benefit from it.
        </p>
        <h3 id="h3">Content Marketing Comes In Many Forms</h3>
        <p>
            Every one of the items on this list is a piece of content that helps you build a connection with your
            customers and
            prospects.
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>
                Marketing and how-to videos
            </li>
            <li>
                White papers and e-books
            </li>
            <li>
                Case studies
            </li>
            <li>
                Blog posts
            </li>
            <li>
                Email newsletters
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="h3"> Videos</h3>
        <p>
            Generally speaking, there's nothing better than an above-the-fold video that introduces visitors to your
            company. Why
            make them hunt for information on your site? People are busy, and you are competing for their time. If you
            can grab
            their interest in 90 seconds with a video introduction to your company, do it! With video, you control the
            tone, the
            pace, and the personality that creates your brand. Music, motion, voice, and design all combine to tell your
            story more
            completely than any other form of content. And how-to videos are vital: they show your customers and
            prospects how to
            unlock all of the value your company offers through its products and services.
        </p>

        <p>
            But video isn't a solution for everything; it's best for introduction and instruction. Think top of funnel
            and end of
            funnel. At the top of the funnel, you're using video to create awareness. At the bottom of the funnel, you
            are providing
            instruction during evaluation – when prospects are doing a trial – and after purchase. And if you're
            constantly updating
            and improving your products and services, your customers should be getting instructional videos about those
            valuable
            improvements as they are released.

        <h3 id="h3">White Papers and E-books</h3>
        <p><img src="versal-wp-microlearning.jpg" alt="sample whitepaper page"
                style="float: left;margin-right: 20px;width: 252px;height: 294px;">
            Once your video has created awareness and introduced your product, white papers and e-books are great for
            the next step:
            discovery and evaluation. If your video and web site copy have done their job, your visitors will want to
            learn more.
            White papers and e-books are a great content offer that you can use to collect contact information from
            interested
            prospects. And, they allow the buyer to download a piece of content to take with them when they leave your
            site, which
            means they still have a connection to you after they leave your site.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use these long-form content formats to show your customers and prospects that you understand their problem
            and can
            provide an effective solution. This is a critical step, because when you show an understanding of your
            prospect's
            problem, you begin to build trust.
        </p>
        <h2>Building Trust</h2>
        <p>
            Ultimately, every piece of content your create is an opportunity to build trust. Your videos and website
            copy should
            build trust by clearly explaining the abilities of your product. Your white papers and e-books should build
            trust by
            showing off your knowledge of the specific industry problems your product solves. And, your case studies
            should build
            trust by showing prospects how customers succeeded with your product.
        </p>
        <h3 id="h3">Case Studies</h3>
        <p><img src="versal-confluence.jpg" alt="sample case study"
                style="float: right;width: 180px;height: 232px;margin-left: 20px;">
            Case studies are one of the most effective ways to build trust with customers. In fact, it will probably be
            one of the
            first things your sales team wants. And if your product works across industry verticals, be sure to create
            case studies
            for each industry. You want prospects to be able to relate to the successes of your existing customers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The case studies themselves aren't difficult to create, and a quick ten minute interview with an existing
            customer is
            plenty of time to get the information you need. Record the interviews; this way you can get exact quotes
            easily. A good
            case study identifies the customer's challenge, your solution, and the result. Be sure to provide some
            background
            information on the customer, too. And make sure you have at least one knock-out quote.
        </p>
        <h2>Getting Better Leads With SEO</h2>
        <p>
            SEO helps your site rank higher for keywords related to your business. When you rank higher for those search
            results,
            people are more likely to click through to one of your pages. If you are ranking for the right keywords,
            then the people
            who reach your site this way should be quality leads. They have a problem, and they are actively searching
            for a
            solution. That means they have intent to make a purchase.
        </p>
        <h3 id="h3">Blog Posts</h3>
        <p>
            Your blog will probably be the number one way you improve your search engine ranking and increase organic
            inbound
            traffic to your site. From a technical standpoint, each blog post should relate to a keyword associated with
            the
            industry you are targeting, and all of your blog posts should have clusters of articles that relate to your
            main
            keywords. These posts cluster posts should all link back to your main keyword pages. And you're going to
            need a lot of
            them, built up over time, to allow search engines to see that your content has value and your site has
            relevance.
        </p>
        <p>
            From a content standpoint, you can talk about almost anything that affects your customers and prospects. And
            because you
            are creating content that is related, you should crosslink between your posts. This allows your readers to
            learn more
            about related issues. And it keeps them on your site longer, which is important because the amount of time
            people stay
            on your site is one of the ways search engines measure the value of your content. That also improves your
            search engine
            rankings.
        </p>
        <h3 id="h3">Email Newsletters</h3>
        <p>
            Newsletters are also a great way to generate traffic to your site. They should go out to every customer who
            hasn't opted
            out of email communications. And if your doing things right, you have email addresses from prospects who
            downloaded one
            of your content offers. Make sure these prospects are on your mailing list, too.
        </p>
        <p>
            The newsletter itself should showcase the best content you've produced each week or month. But don't over-do
            it. Three
            or four items is fine. You want people to actually look at the content you're offering, and you want them to
            click at
            least one of your links. This is much more likely if they have limited number of choices (and of course,
            your content
            has be something they want to read, too). We did one industry specific post, one feature highlight or how-to
            post, a
            case study, and a link to schedule a demo.
        </p>
        <p>
            And don't go crazy with html and graphics. Keep it all text. Make the copy clickable. Make the title the
            link to the
            content. And keep the description below the title to one sentence, if possible.
